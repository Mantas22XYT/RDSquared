# RDSquared

## What is this?
RubyDungSquared (RubyDung^2 or RDSquared for short) is an open source mod for Minecraft Pre-Classic RD-161348, that includes multiple QOL features.

## What does this even add?
Quite a bit! Most notable features are:
- Running;
- More selectable blocks;
- Higher jumping;
- And more!

## Why?
Why not? This is just a little hobby mod, and my actual first attempt at some serious modding!

## How long did this take?
For the first release, it took me 2 hours of coding and messing with the movement to get this up and running, and I don't even know Java!

## Sounds cool, how do I download this?
Just go to the Releases section and download the latest version, then use your favourite launcher to Add or Replace the JAR file, and you're good to go!

## How can I contribute?
You can fork this repo, make changes, and submit them using a pull request. More contributors are always welcome ;)
